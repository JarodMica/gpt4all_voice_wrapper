# gpt4all_voice_wrapper
A quick wrapper for the gpt4all repository using python.  It simply just adds speech recognition for the input and text-to-speech for the output, utilizing the system voice.  You could technically do it with Eleven Labs, you would just need to change the TTS logic of the code.

For demonstration purposes only, I don't plan on maintaining this too much.  You need to clone the gpt4all repo and do the python conversion if you would like to run this code.  I quickly go through how to do this in the YouTube video provided below.
